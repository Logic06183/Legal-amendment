## Working with the Documents

### For Legal Teams
The documents in the **/Lawyer_Editable_Word_Docs/** folder are specifically formatted for legal review with:
- Proper tracked changes
- Consistent formatting across all documents
- Section numbering aligned with the original agreements

### For Technical Teams
- The markdown files in **/Final_Word_Documents/** provide a clean, version-controlled view of changes
- The python scripts allow for automated processing and conversion

## Special Notes on Section Numbering
- RP1_UCT and RP1_WHC use placeholder section numbers (2.Y, 2.Z)
- RP2_WHC and RP1_Old_WHC use specific section numbers (2.20, 2.21)
- All documents maintain consistent content despite numbering differences

## Amendment Effective Date
All documents refer to an "Amendment Effective Date" which will be the date of signature of the last Party to sign the Amendment.
