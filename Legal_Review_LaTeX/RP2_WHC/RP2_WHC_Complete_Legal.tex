ANNEXURE B: DESCRIPTION OF STUDY Study title: Innovative Machine Learning and multi-source data analysis towards the development of an urban heat-health Early Warning System for African cities  Study rationale: African cities are experiencing rapid urbanization and significant increases in temperatures due to climate change, with dire health implications for vulnerable populations. However, data and understanding of heat-health outcomes, exposure, vulnerability, and potential solutions in these urban contexts are critically lacking. This study seeks to fill these gaps by leveraging advanced data science techniques to map and predict urban heat-health risks and inform public health interventions. Study objectives: The study's overall objective is to use innovative data science approaches to quantify the impact of heat exposure on health outcomes in urban African settings and develop a geospatial Early Warning System for urban heat-health risks. The specific objectives are: •	To map intra-urban heat vulnerability and exposure across urban areas in large African cities. •	To develop a collaboration between the HE2AT Center and local stakeholders, including urban planners, public health officials, and community leaders. •	To link health outcome data spatially and temporally with weather, environmental, and socio-economic data. •	To apply machine learning and other advanced analytical methods to predict adverse health outcomes related to heat exposure. •	To develop and implement an Early Warning System to provide targeted alerts to vulnerable populations and guide public health responses. Methods: The study will systematically collect and analyze data from various sources, including longitudinal health studies, satellite imagery, and socio-economic surveys. Machine learning models will be used to identify patterns and predict heat-related health risks. The study will also involve developing a mobile application to disseminate heat warnings and collect user feedback. Ethical and legal considerations: The study has been approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of the University of the Witwatersrand, South Africa. Data privacy and security will be ensured by removing participant identifiers, data encryption, and secure data storage. Funding acknowledgement: The study is funded by the Fogarty International Center and National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) and OD/Office of Strategic Coordination (OSC) of the National Institutes of Health under Award Number U54 TW 012083.

16.	ANNEXURE D: 16.1.	AUTHORSHIP GUIDELINES FOR STUDIES THAT CONTRIBUTE DATA Study Principal Investigators, Site Principal Investigators, and additional contributing study members will be invited to join the authorship group for any publications that use data from their study. •	The authorship guidelines adhere to the ICMJE criteria for authorship, which include: •	Substantial contributions to the conception or design of the work or the acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data for the work; AND •	Drafting the work or revising it critically for important intellectual content; AND •	Final approval of the version to be published; AND •	Agreement to be accountable for all aspects of the work in ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are appropriately investigated and resolved. The authorship guidelines and study acknowledgements are based on an appreciation of the substantial contribution made by Principal Investigators in providing data from their study, and in recognition of the work involved in conducting the study. We will include one author per included study (usually the study PI), but additional country-PI will be included for multi-country studies. The listed authors of the studies contributing data will be named in alphabetical order by surname, from positions 4th author to second-last author. As such, authorships 1-3 and last authorship will be reserved for those who contributed most to the work, in line with ICMJE guidelines. Some journals may restrict the number of authors listed and require that additional authors be included as part of the ‘HE2AT Center Study Group’. In this situation, the HE2AT Center Steering Committee will have the right to decide on final authorship, taking into consideration the studies that contributed the most participants to the RP2 dataset. The study group will be published in an Appendix, where journals allow this or otherwise list it in the acknowledgement section. Here, listing will be done by role in the study and/or by Study/site. Any additional contributors from a study who adhere to ICMJE criteria will be listed as part of the ‘HE2AT Center Study Group’ in an Appendix where journals allow this or otherwise be listed in the acknowledgement section. The name of the funder of the contributing study and of other Principal Investigators will be included in the acknowledgements as relevant. Study Principal Investigators may be granted access to the RP2 De-Identified Data for secondary analyses, provided they complete the Data Request Forms, which will then be reviewed by the Data Access Committee (DAC). Decisions around data access are governed by the HE2AT Center’s Data Management Plan and the Publication Policy Standard Operating Procedures.
