\noindent \textbf{RE: Important Amendment to HE\textsuperscript{2}AT Center Data Transfer Agreement}

\vspace{0.5cm}

\noindent Dear [AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE],

\vspace{0.3cm}

I am writing on behalf of the HE\textsuperscript{2}AT Center regarding our Data Transfer Agreement dated [ORIGINAL AGREEMENT DATE]. We greatly value your contribution to this important research initiative and the scientific insights your data has helped generate.

\section*{Purpose of the Amendment}

We request your approval of an amendment that addresses three critical aspects of the HE\textsuperscript{2}AT Center's data infrastructure:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Migration to Cloud Storage}: NIH funding requirements necessitate moving our data infrastructure from on-premises servers to Microsoft Azure's cloud platform. This migration will enhance security, improve accessibility, and ensure compliance with evolving data protection standards.

\item \textbf{External Researcher Access}: To maximize the scientific value of the research, we seek authorization to share appropriately de-identified data with qualified researchers beyond the HE\textsuperscript{2}AT Center Consortium, subject to rigorous Data Access Committee oversight.

\item \textbf{Long-Term Data Preservation}: Scientific progress requires that valuable research data remain accessible beyond the timeframe of a single project. This amendment establishes a framework for responsible, secure long-term data preservation and use.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Key Protections Maintained and Enhanced}

This amendment maintains and strengthens the protections in our original agreement:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Your data ownership remains unchanged}
\item \textbf{Original Study Data will be deleted after 5 years} unless you explicitly approve longer retention
\item \textbf{Enhanced security measures} through Azure's enterprise-grade platform
\item \textbf{Strict access controls} based on data sensitivity levels
\item \textbf{Comprehensive monitoring and audit trails} for all data access
\item \textbf{Geographic data controls} to maintain regulatory compliance
\end{itemize}

\section*{Enclosed Documents}

Please find enclosed:
\begin{enumerate}
\item A formal Amendment to our Data Transfer Agreement
\item A Technical Appendix detailing the cloud architecture and security measures
\item A Frequently Asked Questions document addressing common questions
\end{enumerate}

\section*{What This Means for Your Data}

Your Original Study Data will continue to be accessible only to the Core Data Team. As data is processed, it will be subject to increasing levels of de-identification:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Level 1 (Consortium Shared Data)}: Accessible only to HE\textsuperscript{2}AT Consortium members
\item \textbf{Level 2 (De-identified Data)}: Accessible to approved external researchers under strict governance
\item \textbf{Level 3 (Inferential Data)}: Highly aggregated data available as an open resource
\end{itemize}

All access to Levels 1-2 is governed by the Data Access Committee and backed by comprehensive audit trails.

\section*{Next Steps}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Please review the enclosed documents at your earliest convenience
\item If you have any questions, contact [CONTACT PERSON] at [EMAIL] or [PHONE]
\item If the amendment is acceptable, please sign and return one copy to us by [DEADLINE DATE]
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Your authorization is essential} to continue the valuable work of the HE\textsuperscript{2}AT Center and to ensure that research data can have its maximum scientific impact. The amendment establishes a robust governance framework that balances open science principles with appropriate privacy protections.

We would be happy to schedule a call to discuss any aspects of this amendment in greater detail.

Thank you for your continued partnership in this critical research endeavor.
