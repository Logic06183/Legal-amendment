6.2 Such safeguards shall be appropriate to the nature of the information to prevent any breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to Personal Data or any other unauthorized or unlawful use, access, alteration, loss, or disclosure of Personal Data relating to this Agreement (collectively, \textbf{"Security Breach"}). Data Recipient will also implement appropriate internal policies, procedures, or protocols to minimize the risk of occurrence of a Security Breach.

6.3 Once the Original Study Data has been transferred to the Data Recipient, the Data Recipient shall, in line with all applicable legislation and regulations, maintain a comprehensive privacy and security program to ensure the safekeeping and integrity of the Original Study Data.

\added{6.4 Following the Cloud Migration, the Data Recipient shall ensure that all safeguards described in this section are implemented and maintained within the Azure Cloud Platform environment, leveraging the platform's security features including but not limited to encryption, access controls, monitoring, and audit logging.}

\added{6.5 The safeguards described in this section shall apply equally to all data access, including access by External Researchers and during Post-Project Data Use periods.}

\added{6.6 The Data Recipient and/or its Successor Governance Entity shall maintain these safeguards for as long as any level of data derived from the Original Study Data is retained.}

\section{SECURITY BREACH}
