# ANNEXURE B:

# DESCRIPTION OF STUDY

Study title: Individual Participant Data meta-analysis to quantify the impact of high ambient temperatures on maternal and child health in Africa

Study rationale: Global temperatures have already increased by 1.1°C since the industrial revolution and are projected to rise by a further 1-2 degrees over the coming decades. Africa is the continent hardest hit by climate change and temperatures are rising at twice the global rate in many parts of the continent.

The harmful impacts of extreme heat on health are well recognised, affecting a range of population groups, including pregnant women and children. There remain, however, major gaps in evidence on the size of temperature impacts, and which outcomes are most affected. Gaps in evidence are especially large in Africa. A study drawing together the rich data collected in trials and cohorts across the continent could provide the information needed to develop solutions to this rapidly escalating public health problem.

An Individual Participant Data (IPD) meta-analysis entails systematically locating, appraising, transforming, and analysing participant-level data from multiple studies which have a common outcome of interest. Unlike classic systematic reviews which use aggregated study-level data extracted from a publication, an IPD involves analyses of raw participant-level data from multiple studies. This approach can overcome many of the biases of classic systematic reviews, and the challenges in understanding heterogeneity and methodological diversity across published studies.

Analysing pooled participant-level data from multiple settings and time periods also holds several notable advantages over analyses of individual databases from a single location and time, most especially through increasing statistical power and generalisability.

</span>

The IPD forms parts of the HE2AT Center (HEat and HEalth African Transdisciplinary Center) which consists of partners from South Africa (University of Cape Town and Wits Health Consortium, and IBM-Research Africa), Côte d’Ivoire (University of Peleforo Gon Coulibaly), Zimbabwe (CeSHHAR), and the United States (Universities of Michigan and Washington). The Center is funded through the United States NIH Harnessing Data Science for Health Discovery and Innovation in Africa (DS-I Africa) program. DS-I Africa aims to make optimum use of existing data resources across Africa to address the most pressing health concerns on the continent.

Study objectives: The overall objective of the study is to use innovative data science approaches to quantify the current and future impacts of heat exposure on maternal and child health in sub-Saharan Africa.

The specific objectives are:

To locate, acquire, collate and transform prospectively collected data from cohort studies and randomized trials on maternal and child health in sub-Saharan Africa.

To develop a collaboration between the HE2AT Center and investigators of each of the studies who contribute participant-level data.

To link health outcome data spatially and temporally with weather and other environmental data, as well as with socio-economic and related factors.

To utilize classic statistical methods and novel machine learning approaches to understand and quantify the impact of heat exposure on maternal and child health.

To document variations in the relationship between heat exposure, and other environmental data, and maternal and child health outcomes across different settings, climate zones and population groups in sub-Saharan Africa.

Methods: Full details of the study have been published in the BMJ Open journal1 and are summed here. We will systematically locate eligible studies through a mapping review of publication databases, the searching of data repositories, and through communicating with experts in the field. Eligibility is based on study- and individual-level criteria. To be eligible, the study needs to include longitudinal data, have enrolled or plan to enrol at least 1000 pregnant women in sub-Saharan Africa, have collected data on key maternal and child outcomes and be identified in publications between January 2012 and June 2022 or through other means such as trial registries or suggestions from other researchers. At an individual level, participants need to have been recruited during pregnancy or intrapartum and have data available on date and location of childbirth. For studies with no date of childbirth, data should be available on date and location of diagnosis of an adverse maternal health outcome, or end of pregnancy in cases of maternal deaths or abortion. Location information may include facility of birth, or city of the study, for example. The datasets from individual studies will be harmonised through the recoding of raw individual participant data into a common set of variables. Various traditional statistical models such as time-series analysis, time-to event analysis and generalised additive models, as well as novel machine learning approaches will be used to quantify associations between high ambient temperatures, and adverse maternal and child outcomes. Data analysis occurs in several stages. Firstly, each study will be analysed individually. Then, data from the individual studies are aggregated to provide a pooled estimate of effect. If heterogeneity between studies is high, then aggregation across studies may not be done, or may only be done in particular groups of studies that share common characteristics.
